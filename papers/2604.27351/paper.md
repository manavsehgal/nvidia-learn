## Abstract

Agentic large language model systems have demonstrated strong capabilities. However, their reliance on language as the universal interface fundamentally limits their applicability to many real-world problems, especially in scientific domains where domain-specific foundation models have been developed to address specialized tasks beyond natural language. In this work, we introduce Eywa, a heterogeneous agentic framework designed to extend language-centric systems to a broader class of scientific foundation models. The key idea of Eywa is to augment domain-specific foundation models with a language-model-based reasoning interface, enabling language models to guide inference over non-linguistic data modalities. This design allows predictive foundation models, which are typically optimized for specialized data and tasks, to participate in higher-level reasoning and decision-making processes within agentic systems. Eywa can serve as a drop-in replacement for a single-agent pipeline (EywaAgent) or be integrated into existing multi-agent systems by replacing traditional agents with specialized agents (EywaMAS). We further investigate a planning-based orchestration framework in which a planner dynamically coordinates traditional agents and Eywa agents to solve complex tasks across heterogeneous data modalities (EywaOrchestra). We evaluate Eywa across a diverse set of scientific domains spanning physical, life, and social sciences. Experimental results demonstrate that Eywa improves performance on tasks involving structured and domain-specific data, while reducing reliance on language-based reasoning through effective collaboration with specialized foundation models.
